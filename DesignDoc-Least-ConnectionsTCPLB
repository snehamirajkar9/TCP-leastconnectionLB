Design Document: TCP Load Balancer

1. Introduction
This document outlines the design and architecture of a basic TCP load balancer. The load balancer is designed to distribute network load across multiple hosts (or upstreams) efficiently. The project consists of two main components: a reusable library implementing load balancing functionality and a server that exposes the library functionality, providing secure communication to clients and an authorization layer.

2. Components
2.1 Library
The library component implements the core functionality of the load balancer. It includes two main features: least connections connection forwarder and per-client connection rate limiter.

2.1.1 Least Connections Connection Forwarder
This component tracks the number of connections per upstream and forwards incoming connections to the upstream with the least number of active connections. This ensures even distribution of the network load across all available upstreams.

2.1.2 Per-Client Connection Rate Limiter
This component limits the rate of connections from individual clients to prevent overload on the upstream servers. It monitors the connection rate from each client and applies rate limiting policies as necessary.

2.2 Server
The server component acts as the interface for clients to interact with the load balancer. It provides secure communication channels using mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication for both clients and servers. Additionally, it includes a simple authorization scheme to define which upstreams are available to which clients.

2.2.1 mTLS Authentication
The server implements mutual TLS authentication to verify the identity of both clients and servers. This ensures secure communication channels between the clients and the load balancer.

2.2.2 Authorization Scheme
A simple authorization scheme is implemented to determine which clients have access to which upstreams. This scheme can be statically defined in the code, mapping clients to authorized upstreams based on predefined rules.

2.2.3 Connection Handling
The server accepts incoming connections from clients and forwards them to the appropriate upstream using the functionality provided by the library component. It manages the communication flow between clients and upstreams, ensuring proper load balancing and rate limiting.

3. Architecture
3.1 High-Level Architecture
The high-level architecture explains how requests are redirected to the server with the fewest active connections, requiring additional computation by the load balancer to identify less-busy servers.


Client: Initiates connections to the load balancer.
Server: Accepts incoming connections from clients and forwards them to the appropriate upstream.
Library: Implements load balancing and rate limiting functionality.
Upstreams: Backend servers that handle the actual workload.
3.2 Communication Flow
Client Connection: Clients establish a connection to the server component of the load balancer.
Authentication: Mutual TLS authentication is performed between the client and the server to verify identities.
Authorization: The server checks the authorization of the client and determines which upstreams are accessible.
Connection Forwarding: The server forwards incoming connections to the appropriate upstream based on load balancing algorithms implemented in the library.
Rate Limiting: The library component applies per-client connection rate limiting policies to prevent overload on the upstream servers.
Data Transmission: Data is transmitted between the client and the selected upstream server.


4. Implementation Considerations
4.1 Language and Framework
The load balancer and server components will be implemented using a suitable programming language such as Python, Go, or Java. Standard libraries and frameworks will be utilized for implementing TLS, authorization, and communication protocols.

4.2 Load Balancing Algorithms
The library component will implement a least connections connection forwarder algorithm to distribute incoming connections evenly across upstream servers. Other load balancing algorithms such as round-robin or weighted round-robin may be implemented based on future requirements.

4.3 Rate Limiting Mechanism
The per-client connection rate limiter will be implemented in the library component using appropriate data structures and algorithms to track and limit connection rates effectively.

4.4 Security Measures
Strict security measures, including mutual TLS authentication and authorization, will be implemented to ensure secure communication channels and access control between clients and the load balancer.

4.5 Scalability and Performance
The load balancer will be designed for scalability and high performance to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently. Performance testing and optimization will be conducted to ensure optimal performance under varying load conditions.

5. Conclusion
This design document provides an overview of the architecture and implementation considerations for a basic TCP load balancer. By implementing load balancing and rate limiting functionality in a reusable library and providing secure communication channels and authorization layers in the server component, the load balancer will efficiently distribute network load while ensuring security and scalability.
